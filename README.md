In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis divided into four key sections:

1. Overview – A general snapshot of marketing spend, yield, and performance across different campaigns.
2. Campaign Performance – Focused on individual ad campaigns, analyzing ROI, cost-per-click (CPC), and other performance metrics.
3. Channel Analysis – Comparing the performance of various advertising channels (social media, search ads, display ads) and identifying the most effective ones.
4. Optimization Insights – A data-driven look at how spending patterns could be adjusted to improve efficiency and boost returns.

Cost-Yield Breakdown – A detailed breakdown of costs and returns across different campaigns and channels, highlighting key trends and opportunities for optimization.
